    <h3 class="topics">BUT WHAT THE HECK IS CRICKET?</h3>
    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that’s as English as afternoon tea but has taken the world by storm, especially in countries like India, Australia, and the West Indies. Think of it as baseball’s quirky cousin with a flair for the dramatic. Two teams of eleven players each battle it out on a grassy field, with one team batting to score runs while the other bowls and fields to stop them. The twist? Matches can last from a few hours in T20 games to a staggering five days in Test matches!
</p><p>
      The game unfolds on a 22-yard strip called a pitch, where bowlers hurl the ball at batsmen who try to whack it as far as possible. Runs are scored by sprinting back and forth between two sets of stumps or by sending the ball to the boundary for four or six runs. Meanwhile, fielders scatter across the field, ready to catch the ball, throw it at the stumps, or stop those pesky runs.
      </p><p>
      Cricket’s formats vary wildly. In T20 matches, it’s all about high-octane thrills and quick results, perfect for those with short attention spans. ODIs, or One Day Internationals, stretch the fun over a day with 50 overs per side. But if you’re a true cricket aficionado, Test matches are where it’s at – a five-day marathon of strategy, endurance, and tea breaks.
      </p><p>      International cricket is governed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), which organizes major events like the ICC Cricket World Cup and the ICC T20 World Cup. Domestically, leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL) bring glitz, glamour, and big bucks to the game.
      
      In essence, cricket is a sport of glorious unpredictability, where gentlemanly conduct meets fierce competition. It’s a game that can turn heroes into legends and moments into memories, all while keeping millions of fans around the world glued to their screens, cheering for every six, wicket, and miraculous catch.</p>

    <h3 class="topics">HOW DO I START WITH IT?</h3>
    <p>Getting started with cricket is like diving into a world where strategy meets sheer fun, with a sprinkle of tradition. Grab a bat, a ball, and some friends, and find yourself a patch of green – your local park will do just fine. If you're the batter, your job is to whack that ball as far as you can and run like the wind between two sets of stumps. If you're the bowler, channel your inner fast or spin wizard and try to knock those stumps over. Fielders, you're the acrobats, diving to stop the ball and throwing it back with precision. No fancy gear? No problem! A makeshift bat, a tennis ball, and some improvised stumps (a tree works wonders) are all you need to start. It's all about having fun, so don't worry about getting it right the first time. With a bit of practice and a lot of laughs, you'll be on your way to cricketing glory in no time!</p>
